# Keycloak realm issuer URL
# Format: http(s)://host:port/realms/{realm-name}
#
# IMPORTANT - One issuer URL for browser + app:
# OIDC issuer URLs are strict: the URL configured in the app MUST match the issuer
# returned by Keycloak's discovery document.
#
# This template standardizes on a single issuer URL that works for both:
# - Browsers on the host:              http://localhost:8180/...
# - App running inside Docker:         http://localhost:8180/...
#
# This is achieved via docker-compose.yml using:
#   app.extra_hosts: ["localhost:host-gateway"]
# which makes `localhost` inside the container resolve to the host gateway.
OIDC_ISSUER="http://localhost:8180/realms/local"

# Callback URL after Keycloak authentication
# Must match OIDC_CLIENT_ID's redirect URI in Keycloak

# HTTP Server Timeouts
# ======================================
# Timeouts prevent hanging connections and resource exhaustion
# All values use Go duration format: "5s", "100ms", "1m", etc.

# Maximum time to wait for idle client connections to close
SERVER_IDLE_TIMEOUT="5s"

# Maximum time to read request headers (prevents Slowloris attacks)
SERVER_READ_HEADER_TIMEOUT="5s"

# Maximum time to read entire request body
SERVER_READ_TIMEOUT="5s"

# Maximum time to write response back to client
SERVER_WRITE_TIMEOUT="5s"

# ======================================
# Resilience & Stability (cloud-native-utils)
# ======================================
# Thresholds and parameters for fault tolerance and graceful degradation

# Circuit breaker: number of failures before opening circuit
# Open circuit = fast-fail without attempting request
SERVICE_BREAKER_THRESHOLD="5"

# Rate limiting: maximum events per second to process
# Excess events are debounced (dropped or batched)
SERVICE_DEBOUNCE_PER_SEC="10"

# Retry mechanism: delay between retry attempts
# Used for transient failures (network timeouts, 5xx errors)
SERVICE_RETRY_DELAY="5s"

# Retry mechanism: maximum number of attempts
# Total time: SERVICE_RETRY_MAX * SERVICE_RETRY_DELAY (up to 15 seconds here)
SERVICE_RETRY_MAX="3"

# Service call timeout: max time for external calls
# Prevents indefinite hangs on slow dependencies
