|-----------------------|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Circuit Breaker**   | Stability       | Prevents repeated failures by temporarily stopping calls to a failing service.  | Use when you have an external service or resource that might intermittently fail, and you want to avoid overloading it while giving it time to recover.   |
| **Debounce**          | Stability       | Prevents multiple rapid invocations of a function by delaying the execution.    | Use when handling high-frequency events (like user inputs or system notifications) where only the last action in a burst is needed.                    |
| **Retry**             | Stability       | Automatically retries a failed operation a specified number of times.           | Use when operations may fail intermittently due to transient issues (e.g., network timeouts or temporary service unavailability).                        |
| **Throttle**          | Stability       | Limits the rate at which a function is executed, enforcing a steady flow.       | Use when you want to limit how often an action can occur (e.g., API rate limiting, controlling resource consumption).                                    |
| **Timeout**           | Stability       | Ensures a function or operation doesn't run indefinitely by setting a maximum allowed time. | Use when an operation has the potential to hang or take too long, and you need to enforce a time limit for safety or performance reasons.                |
| **Generate**          | Efficiency      | Creates or generates a stream of data or tasks to be processed.                 | Use when you need to generate a sequence of values or tasks for further processing, typically in bulk operations.                                        |
| **Merge**             | Efficiency      | Combines multiple streams of data into one.                                     | Use when you have multiple sources of data or tasks that need to be processed together, such as aggregating results from different services or streams.    |
| **Process**           | Efficiency      | Executes a function concurrently or in parallel across multiple tasks or data points. | Use when you want to run multiple tasks simultaneously, either in a single process (concurrent) or across multiple processes or systems (parallel). This is ideal for independent tasks that can be executed simultaneously for improved throughput. |
| **Sharding**          | Efficiency      | Distributes data across multiple storage units or services to balance load.     | Use when you need to handle large datasets or workloads, distributing them across multiple systems or nodes for better scalability and fault tolerance.    |
| **Split**             | Efficiency      | Divides a stream or data set into smaller parts for concurrent processing.      | Use when you need to divide data into chunks to enable parallel or concurrent processing for improved performance.                                        |
